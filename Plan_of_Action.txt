Here's the step-by-step plan in simple English for analyzing face recognition techniques in low-quality blurred images:
Step 1: Image Input and Initial Analysis
    User uploads an image through the Streamlit interface
    System performs initial checks:
    Image quality assessment
    Blur level detection
    Resolution check
    Noise level measurement
Step 2: Implementation of Three Face Recognition Techniques
    Technique 1: Eigenface Analysis
        Analyze how well eigenface method works with blurred image
        Measure recognition confidence
        Record processing time
        Store results for comparison
    Technique 2: Local Binary Pattern (LBP) Analysis
        Apply LBP method to the blurred image
        Calculate feature matching accuracy
        Measure processing performance
        Store results for comparison
    Technique 3: Deep Learning Analysis
        Use deep learning model for recognition
        Calculate recognition accuracy
        Record processing time
        Store results for comparison
Step 3: Analysis Types for Each Technique
For each technique, we analyze:
